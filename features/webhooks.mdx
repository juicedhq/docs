description: Send real-time event data to external systems.
---

Webhooks let you send data to external systems whenever specific events occur in Juiced. When an event fires, the system sends a payload to your configured URL.

## Creating a webhook

1. Navigate to the webhooks settings page
2. Select the event you want to listen for
3. Click create
4. Configure the destination URL and payload

## Available events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Customer Created | A new customer account is created |
| Lead Assigned | A single lead is assigned to a customer |
| Lead Not Assigned | A lead fails to be assigned after exhausting all distribution stages |
| Leads Assigned | Multiple leads are assigned at once (e.g., bulk marketplace purchase) |
| Lead Duplicated | A lead is rejected as a duplicate |
| Lead Not Assigned | A lead could not be assigned to any customer |
| Lead Posted | A lead is sent to an external system |
| Transaction Updated | A transaction is created or updated |
| County Lead Type Stats Updated | Lead type statistics are updated at the county level |
| State Lead Type Stats Updated | Lead type statistics are updated at the state level |
| User Attached to Customer | A user is added to a customer account |

## Payload templates

Webhook payloads are JSON. You can customize the payload structure using a template with merge fields in double curly braces: `{{ variable_name }}`.

Lead-based events (Lead Assigned, Leads Assigned, Lead Not Assigned, Lead Duplicated, and Lead Posted) all share the same payload structure. This includes a `{{ deliverable_fields }}` variable that dynamically expands to all deliverable fields for the lead category as raw JSON key-value pairs. The payload automatically adapts when fields are added or removed from a lead category—no template changes needed.

### Field access

Lead fields are available in two formats:

- **Flat**: `{{ first_name }}`, `{{ email }}`, `{{ phone }}`
- **Nested**: `{{ lead.first_name }}`, `{{ lead.email }}`, `{{ lead.phone }}`

Both formats work identically. The nested format is useful when building complex templates or integrating with systems that expect a specific payload structure. Custom fields from the lead category are accessible via `{{ lead.details.field_name }}`.

## How it works

When one of your configured events occurs, Juiced sends an HTTP request to your specified URL with the relevant payload. This allows you to:

- Sync data to your CRM
- Trigger automations in external tools
- Update dashboards or reporting systems
- Send notifications through your own channels
