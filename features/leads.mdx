title: Leads
description: The central entity in Juiced—what they are, their statuses, and lifecycle.
---

Leads are the fruit of your labor. Literally everything in Juiced exists to get leads from point A (your sources) to point B (your customers) while making sure you get paid along the way.

A lead is a person who's expressed interest in something—a quote, a service, a product. Your job is to connect that person with a customer who can help them. Juiced handles the messy middle: validation, routing, bidding, delivery, and the occasional dispute.

## Lead statuses

Every lead has a status that tells you where it is in its journey. Here's what each one means:

| Status | What it means |
|--------|---------------|
| **Pending** | Just arrived. Waiting to be matched with a customer. |
| **Assigned** | Given to a customer. They've got it, whether or not the transaction is complete. |
| **Posted** | Sent out of the system to a partner via an external post. |
| **Duplicate** | Matched an existing lead. Rejected to avoid double-selling. |
| **Returned** | Customer returned it. Maybe the phone number was fake, maybe the lead wasn't what they expected. |
| **Unassigned** | Couldn't find a buyer. No matching bids, or everyone's out of budget. |
| **Withheld** | On hold because you've hit your threshold. Will process once capacity frees up. |
| **Marketplace** | Available for customers to claim rather than being pushed to a specific buyer. |
| **Audit** | Flagged for manual review based on your audit conditions. |
| **Uncategorized** | Doesn't match any segment, and no fallback was configured to catch it. |

A lead is considered "sold" if it's Assigned, Posted, or Returned. Yes, even returned leads count as sold—you delivered them, and the customer chose to return them afterward.

## Viewing leads

Tenants can view leads assigned to any customer. The lead detail page shows:

- **UUID** — The unique identifier for the lead
- **Basic contact information** — Name, email, phone, etc.
- **Metadata** — Source, timestamps, assignment info, charged amount
- **Details** — Custom fields defined by the lead type or source

### Field visibility

Not all fields are visible to everyone:

- **Tenants** see all fields on a lead
- **Customers** only see fields marked as "deliverable" in the lead type configuration

This lets you collect data for your own purposes (like tracking or analytics) without exposing it to buyers.

### Related records

If the lead was generated through ping-post, you'll see links to view:

- **The ping** — The initial request that triggered the auction
- **The post** — The follow-up request that delivered the full lead data

These links only appear when the related records exist.

## Lead actions

### Returning leads

Tenants can return leads on behalf of customers. When a lead is returned:

- The customer's wallet is credited with the charged amount
- The lead no longer counts against bidding limits
- The customer retains access to the lead data
- The lead status changes to "Returned"

### Editing leads

Tenants can edit **unassigned** leads to correct data or add missing information. When editing:

- **Lead data** can be changed (contact info, custom fields)
- **Metadata** cannot be changed (source, timestamps, etc.)
- **Details** can be added if needed

When you save an edited lead, it gets reclassified into the appropriate lead type and segment based on the updated data.

### Reprocessing leads

After editing, tenants can choose to reprocess the lead. You can select which stage of the distribution plan to start from—useful if you want to skip steps that have already been attempted or start fresh from the beginning.

### Deleting leads

Tenants can delete leads entirely. This removes the lead from the system. Use this for test data or leads that should never have entered the system in the first place.

### Exporting leads

Tenants can export leads from a customer's lead list. This generates a downloadable file of the lead data—useful for reporting, backups, or moving data to external systems.

### Importing leads

Tenants can import leads on behalf of a customer. Imported leads create **reverse auctions** on the marketplace, where sources can bid to fulfill them. This flips the typical flow—instead of leads coming in and customers bidding on them, the customer is saying "I want leads matching these criteria" and sources compete to provide them.
