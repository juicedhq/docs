You know that moment when you're clicking around an app and you find a button that says something like "Configure Routing Logic" and you think, "I have no idea what that means but I'm definitely going to click it"? This section is here to catch you after that click.

Each page covers a specific part of Juiced—what it does, how it works, and what you need to know to use it effectively. We've organized everything by the nouns you'll encounter: Campaigns, Buyers, Leads, Webhooks, and so on. When you need to look something up, this is where you look.

## What you'll find here

- **Core concepts** — The building blocks of Juiced and how they fit together
- **Platform components** — Deep dives into each part of the system
- **Configuration options** — All the knobs and dials, explained

## What you won't find here

Step-by-step instructions for accomplishing specific goals. That's what [Guides](/guides) are for. Features tells you what the juicer does; Guides tells you how to make orange juice.

If you're ever reading a feature page and thinking "okay, but how do I actually *use* this?"—good instinct. Finish reading to understand the concept, then head to Guides to put it into practice.
