Welcome to Juiced. Let's get you set up and ready to start making money. The whole process takes about five minutes—less time than it takes to juice an orange by hand.

## Create your account

Head over to [usejuiced.com/register](https://usejuiced.com/register) and fill out the registration form. You'll pick a subdomain for your account (like `yourcompany.usejuiced.com`), so choose something you won't be embarrassed to share with buyers.

Once you submit, you'll be redirected to your shiny new subdomain.

## Log in

You're now on your own turf. Log in with the credentials you just created.

If you're staring at a login screen wondering what your subdomain was, check your email—we sent you a confirmation with all the details.

## Set up your subscription

Before you can start selling, you'll need to pick a subscription plan. Choose the one that fits your operation and complete the checkout.

No subscription means no selling, so don't skip this step and then wonder why nothing's working.

## Connect Stripe

Juiced uses Stripe to handle payouts. You'll be prompted to connect your Stripe account so we know where to send your money.

If you don't have a Stripe account yet, you can create one during this step. Stripe will walk you through their onboarding, then send you back to Juiced when you're done.

## Select your country

Tell us which country you operate in. This helps us handle compliance and keep everything running smoothly on your end.

## You're in

That's it. You're now looking at your dashboard, ready to set up your first campaign and start routing leads.

- Set up your first campaign

Welcome to Juiced. Time to squeeze some value out of your leads.
