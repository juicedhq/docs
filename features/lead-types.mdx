description: How leads are categorized and routed using conditions.

Lead types are a refinement of a [lead category](/features/lead-categories) that provide additional classification. While lead categories define who a person is and what they want, lead types help identify their level of intent and value.

## Conditions

Each lead type has conditions that determine which leads it matches. Conditions use fields from the parent lead category to evaluate incoming leads.

To create a condition, you:

1. Select a field from the lead category
2. Choose an operator (options vary based on the field's data type)
3. Enter a value to check against

You can add as many conditions as needed.

### Condition logic

Conditions are organized into groups with the following logic:

- **Within a group**: Conditions are combined with AND (all must be true)
- **Between groups**: Groups are combined with OR (any group can match)

<Accordion title="Example: Home insurance leads">
Say you want to create a lead type for high-value home insurance leads. You might set up conditions like:

**Group 1** (homeowners with high property values):
- `property_type` equals `single_family` AND
- `estimated_value` greater than `500000`

**Group 2** (new construction):
- `year_built` greater than `2020` AND
- `square_footage` greater than `2500`

A lead matches this lead type if it satisfies all conditions in Group 1 OR all conditions in Group 2.
</Accordion>

## Fallback lead types

A fallback lead type catches any lead that doesn't match other lead types within the same lead category. When you create a lead category, a lead type is automatically generated and configured as the fallback.

When the fallback option is enabled:
- Conditions are hidden (since fallback matches everything that didn't match elsewhere)
- Priority is automatically set to the lowest

To add conditions to a fallback lead type, you must first uncheck the fallback option.

## Priority

Priority determines the order in which lead types are evaluated when a lead could match multiple lead types.

If your lead types have non-overlapping conditions, priority doesn't matter—each lead will only ever match one lead type. But if a lead could qualify for multiple lead types, the one with the highest priority wins.

<Accordion title="Example: Overlapping lead types">
Imagine you have two lead types for auto insurance leads:

- **Premium Drivers** (priority 1): `age` greater than `25` AND `violations` equals `0`
- **Standard Drivers** (priority 2): `age` greater than `25`

A 30-year-old with no violations matches both lead types. Because Premium Drivers has a higher priority, they're placed there instead of Standard Drivers.
</Accordion>

<Note>
Priority only applies to non-fallback lead types. Fallback lead types are always evaluated last.

## Bidding scopes

Bidding scopes define how customers can bid on leads within a lead type. You create them by configuring:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Geographic level | The level at which bids are placed: county, state, or nationwide |
| Fixed Price | When enabled, customers pay a single set price instead of bidding within a range |
| Minimum bid | The lowest bid a customer can place (or the single price when Fixed Price is enabled) |
| Maximum bid | The highest bid a customer can place (hidden when Fixed Price is enabled) |
| Increment | The amount by which bids increase (hidden when Fixed Price is enabled) |
| Enabled | Toggle to activate or deactivate the scope |

<Tip>
Use **Fixed Price** when you want all customers to pay the same amount for leads—no bidding, no competition on price. This is ideal for flat-rate pricing models.
</Tip>

Until at least one bidding scope is enabled for a lead type, customers won't see any bidding options when they try to place a bid.

## Marketplace settings

Lead types also control marketplace behavior for leads that go unsold through normal distribution. See [Marketplace](/features/marketplace) for details on configuring these settings.
