title: Introduction
description: Step-by-step walkthroughs to help you accomplish specific goals with Juiced.
---

Every guide here starts with a goal and ends with that goal accomplished. No detours into theory, no "in a future section we'll cover..." cliffhangers. You came here to do something, and we respect your time.

## What you'll find here

- **Implementation guides** — Step-by-step walkthroughs for setting up specific functionality
- **Business strategies** — Ways to structure your operation that you might not have considered
- **Advanced techniques** — For when the basics aren't cutting it anymore

## A note on business strategies

We're not just documenting software here. Lead generation is a business, and Juiced is flexible enough to support a lot of different approaches. Some of our most valuable guides aren't about which buttons to click—they're about how to think about your operation.

Maybe you've been doing exclusive leads and wondering if ping-post could work for you. Maybe you're selling to three buyers and wondering what changes when you're selling to thirty. We've seen a lot of setups, and we like sharing what works.

## What you won't find here

Detailed explanations of what things are and how they work under the hood. If a guide tells you to "configure your campaign's routing rules" and you're thinking "wait, what's a routing rule?"—pop over to [Features](/features), get the lay of the land, then come back.

Think of it this way: Features is the ingredients list; Guides is the recipe. Both are useful, but you probably don't want to read the nutritional information when you're trying to bake a cake.
