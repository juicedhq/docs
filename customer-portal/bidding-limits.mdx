title: Bidding Limits
description: Pause your account and set caps on leads and spending.
---

The Bidding Limits page gives you account-level controls to manage your lead volume and spending. These settings apply to all your bids.

## Pause account

Toggle this on to temporarily stop all bidding activity. When paused:

- None of your bids will compete for leads
- You won't receive any leads through the bidding system
- You can still purchase leads directly from the Marketplace

This is useful when you need to take a break—going on vacation, catching up on existing leads, or managing cash flow—without deleting your bid configurations.

## Lead caps

Set limits on how many leads you receive:

| Cap | What it does |
|-----|--------------|
| **Daily cap** | Maximum leads per day |
| **Weekly cap** | Maximum leads per week |
| **Monthly cap** | Maximum leads per month |

Once you hit a cap, your bids stop competing until the period resets. Your existing bid configurations remain intact.

## Budgets

Set limits on how much you spend:

| Budget | What it does |
|--------|--------------|
| **Daily budget** | Maximum spend per day |
| **Weekly budget** | Maximum spend per week |
| **Monthly budget** | Maximum spend per month |

When you hit a budget limit, your bids stop competing until the period resets.

<Note>
Your provider determines which caps and budgets are available. You may not see all options if they haven't been enabled.
