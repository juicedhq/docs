The Bids page is where you create and manage your bidding profiles. Each bid targets a specific location and segment combination, and competes against other customers for leads in that area.

## Bids table

The table shows all your bids with tabs to filter by status:

- **All** — Every bid you've created
- **Active** — Bids that are currently competing for leads
- **Limited** — Bids that are restricted due to caps, budgets, or wallet balance
- **Inactive** — Bids that are paused or not competing

### Table columns

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Location** | The geographic area the bid targets |
| **Status** | Whether the bid is active, limited, or inactive |
| **Your bid** | The amount you're bidding |
| **Top bid** | The highest bid for that segment and location |
| **Position** | Your rank among competing bidders |
| **Lead type** | The segment this bid applies to |
| **Caps/Budgets** | Any limits set on this bid |

You can pause or unpause bids directly from the table without opening the edit modal.

## Bid statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Active** | Your bid is competing for leads normally |
| **Limited** | Your bid is restricted—check your wallet balance, caps, or budgets |
| **Inactive** | Your bid is paused and not competing |

## Bid position

Your position shows where you rank among all bidders for a given segment and location. Position 1 means you're the top bidder and will win leads in that area (assuming you have sufficient funds and haven't hit any limits).

If multiple customers bid the same amount, they share the same position and leads are distributed among them.

## Creating a new bid

1. **Search for a location** — Type a county, state, or country name. Matching options appear as you type.
2. **Refine your search** — Check or uncheck scopes to filter the results (e.g., show only counties, only states).
3. **Select a location** — Click on a location to see available segments.

### Setting your bid price

Once you've selected a location, you'll see a list of segments you can bid on. For each segment:

- The **minimum bid** is displayed
- Click the button on the right to set your price
- Use the **arrows** to bump the price up or down in increments
- Click on the **bid price** to see a dropdown of all possible amounts
- The display shows whether your price will be **top**, **tied**, or **under** the current leader

To the right of the price, you'll find buttons to:
- **Clear** the bid
- **Set limits** (caps or budgets enabled by your provider)

You can add as many bids as you like. When you're done, click **Save Bids** to return to the table.

## Editing an existing bid

Click **Edit** on any bid to open the modal. You'll see all available segments for that location and can adjust prices, add new segments, or remove existing bids. Click **Save Bids** when finished.

## Smart pricing

<Note>
Your provider uses smart pricing, which means you only pay what's necessary to win—not your maximum bid.
</Note>

Smart pricing ensures you never overpay for a lead. Even if you set a high bid to guarantee top position, you'll only pay one increment above the next highest bidder.

**Example:** If the minimum bid is $10 with $10 increments, and you bid $100 while the next closest bidder is at $10, you'll pay $20 when you win—not $100.

This lets you bid confidently for top position without worrying about overpaying when competition is low.
