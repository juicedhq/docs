title: Leads
description: The central entity in Juiced—what they are, their statuses, and lifecycle.

Leads are the fruit of your labor. Literally everything in Juiced exists to get leads from point A (your sources) to point B (your customers) while making sure you get paid along the way.

A lead is a person who's expressed interest in something—a quote, a service, a product. Your job is to connect that person with a customer who can help them. Juiced handles the messy middle: validation, routing, bidding, delivery, and the occasional dispute.

## Lead statuses

Every lead has a status that tells you where it is in its journey. Here's what each one means:

| Status | What it means |
|--------|---------------|
| **Pending** | Just arrived. Waiting to be matched with a customer. |
| **Assigned** | Given to a customer. They've got it, whether or not the transaction is complete. |
| **Posted** | Sent out of the system to a partner via an external post. |
| **Duplicate** | Matched an existing lead. Rejected to avoid double-selling. |
| **Returned** | Customer returned it. Maybe the phone number was fake, maybe the lead wasn't what they expected. |
| **Unassigned** | Couldn't find a buyer. No matching bids, or everyone's out of budget. |
| **Withheld** | On hold because you've hit your threshold. Will process once capacity frees up. |
| **Marketplace** | Available for customers to claim rather than being pushed to a specific buyer. |
| **Audit** | Flagged for manual review based on your audit conditions. |
| **Uncategorized** | Doesn't match any segment, and no fallback was configured to catch it. |

A lead is considered "sold" if it's Assigned, Posted, or Returned. Yes, even returned leads count as sold—you delivered them, and the customer chose to return them afterward.

## What's in a lead

Every lead captures a core set of data:

- **Contact info**: First name, last name, email, phone
- **Address**: Street address, city, state, zip, county
- **Source**: Where the lead came from
- **Lead type**: What category of lead this is (more on this in [Lead Types](/features/lead-types))

Beyond these basics, leads can carry custom fields defined by your lead type. Need to capture "roof type" for home improvement leads? "Coverage amount" for insurance? Those go in the lead's details.

### What gets delivered

Not everything you capture gets sent to customers. Each field can be marked as "deliverable" or kept internal. This lets you collect data for routing decisions without exposing it to buyers.

For example, you might use a "credit score range" field to route leads to different segments, but never actually send that value to customers.

## How leads flow through the system

Here's the journey of a typical lead:

1. **Submission**: A source sends lead data via API
2. **Duplicate check**: Is this person already in the system? If yes, reject as duplicate
3. **Audit check**: Does this lead match any red-flag conditions? If yes, hold for review
4. **Segment matching**: Based on the lead's data, which segment does it belong to?
5. **Assignment**: Find the best customer bid and charge their wallet
6. **Delivery**: Send the lead data to the customer

If anything goes wrong along the way—no matching segment, no available bids, insufficient funds—the lead lands in the appropriate status and waits.

## Geographic scoping

Leads are tied to geography, and so are customer bids. A customer might bid on leads from a specific county, an entire state, or nationwide.

When assigning a lead, Juiced looks for bids in this order:
1. County-level bids (most specific)
2. State-level bids
3. Nationwide bids (least specific)

The `assigned_scope` on each lead tells you which level ultimately matched. This matters for reporting—if you're selling mostly at the county level, your customers are getting exactly what they want. If everything's falling through to nationwide, you might need more granular bids.

## When things go sideways

### Disputes

Customers can return leads they're not happy with. When they do, the lead moves to Disputed status. Depending on your dispute tier settings, the customer might get a full refund, a partial refund, or just a note in their permanent record.

Disputes happen. A 5% dispute rate is normal. A 30% dispute rate means something's broken—either your lead quality or your customer expectations.

### Withheld leads

If you've hit your processing threshold, incoming leads get withheld rather than rejected outright. Once capacity frees up, withheld leads automatically process.

This gives you a buffer when volume spikes. Instead of losing leads during a surge, you queue them up and work through them as bandwidth allows.

### Uncategorized leads

If a lead doesn't match any of your segment conditions and you haven't configured a fallback segment, it ends up uncategorized. These leads are in limbo—they made it into the system but have nowhere to go.

If you're seeing uncategorized leads, you have two options: tighten your segment conditions to catch them, or set up a fallback segment as a safety net.
