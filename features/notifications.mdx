Notification templates let you customize the messaging customers receive when events happen in the system. You control the verbiage, formatting, and what details are included in each notification.

## Channels

Each notification can be delivered through three channels:

| Channel | Description | Requirements |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| Email | Sent via SendGrid | [SendGrid integration](/features/integrations#sendgrid) |
| SMS | Sent via Twilio | [Twilio integration](/features/integrations#twilio) |
| In-App | Displayed in the customer portal | None |

Each channel has its own template, so you can tailor the message format and length appropriately—detailed HTML emails, concise text messages, and quick in-app alerts.

## Notification events

Templates are available for the following events:

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Lead Assigned | A single lead is assigned to a customer |
| Leads Assigned | Multiple leads are assigned at once |
| Outbid | Customer's bid is outbid by another customer |
| Bid Matched | Another customer matches the bid amount |
| Buy Order Exceeded | Customer's buy order is exceeded by another |
| Buy Order Reinstated | Customer's buy order becomes the highest bid again |
| Customer Paused | Customer's account is paused |
| Customer Unpaused | Customer's account is unpaused |
| Customer Archived | Customer's account is archived |
| Customer Restored | Customer's account is restored from archive |
| Dispute Approved | Customer's return request is approved |
| Dispute Tier Updated | Customer's return tier changes |
| Payment Failed | A payment transaction fails |
| Payment Successful | A payment processes successfully |
| Under Funded Bids | Customer has bids limited by their available balance |

## Template variables

Templates support merge fields using double curly braces: `{{ variable_name }}`. Available variables depend on the notification type.

### Common variables

These are available in all templates:

- `{{ actionLink }}` - URL to the relevant page
- `{{ defaultActionText }}` - Default text for the action button
- `{{ supportEmail }}` - Your tenant's support email

### Lead variables

Available for lead-related notifications (Lead Assigned, Outbid, Bid Matched, Dispute Approved):

- `{{ lead.uuid }}`
- `{{ lead.full_name }}`, `{{ lead.first_name }}`, `{{ lead.last_name }}`
- `{{ lead.email }}`, `{{ lead.phone }}`
- `{{ lead.address_1 }}`, `{{ lead.address_2 }}`, `{{ lead.city }}`
- `{{ lead.segment.name }}`
- `{{ lead.details.field_name }}` - Any custom field on the lead type

### Customer variables

Available for customer-related notifications:

- `{{ customer.name }}`, `{{ customer.email }}`, `{{ customer.phone }}`
- `{{ customer.address }}`, `{{ customer.city }}`, `{{ customer.state }}`, `{{ customer.zip }}`
- `{{ customer.leads_count }}` - For batch notifications

### Other variables

- **Buy order notifications**: `{{ buyOrder.amount }}`, `{{ buyOrder.scope }}`, `{{ buyOrder.status }}`
- **Dispute tier notifications**: `{{ disputeTier.name }}`, `{{ disputeTier.discount_percentage }}`, `{{ disputeTier.penalty_percentage }}`

## Editing templates

Each notification type has separate templates for each channel. When editing:

- **Email**: Supports rich text formatting (bold, italic, underline, strikethrough)
- **SMS**: Plain text only—keep it concise
- **In-App**: Supports basic formatting

Templates are validated when you save to ensure all variables are valid for that notification type. If you reference a variable that doesn't exist, you'll see an error.

You can reset any template to its default at any time.
