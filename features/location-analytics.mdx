description: Understand customer demand by geography to make smarter decisions about where to invest.

Location analytics shows you where your customers want leads—and where they're actually getting them. This data helps you make informed decisions about ad spend, source partnerships, and pricing strategy. If customers are bidding heavily in Miami but you're barely sourcing leads there, that's a gap worth closing.

The system breaks down location data at three levels: countries, states, and counties. Each level shows the same core metrics, just at different geographic scopes.

## Location overview

Navigate to **Analytics > Locations** and choose your geographic level (countries, states, or counties). You'll see a table with demand and performance data for each location.

### Demand columns

| Column | What it shows |
|--------|---------------|
| **Active bids** | Count of fully operating bids in this location—customers who are actively buying |
| **Top bid** | The highest bid amount in this location |

### Lead performance columns

| Column | What it shows |
|--------|---------------|
| **Leads** | Total leads received in this location |
| **Assigned** | How many of those leads were successfully assigned to customers |
| **Min** | Lowest sale price among assigned leads |
| **Max** | Highest sale price among assigned leads |
| **Avg** | Average sale price among assigned leads |

### Filtering and export

By default, the table shows data across all lead types. Use the lead type filter to narrow down to a specific lead type—useful if you want to see where demand is strongest for auto insurance versus home insurance, for example.

You can export the current view to CSV for further analysis or reporting.

## Individual location view

Click on any location to see detailed information about that specific geography.

### Overview metrics

- **Active bids** — Count of fully operating bids for this location
- **Interested customers** — Customers who have *any* bid on this location, including paused or otherwise inactive bids
- **Top bid** — The highest bid amount

The distinction between active bids and interested customers matters. Active bids tell you current demand. Interested customers tell you *potential* demand—people who've shown interest but might be paused due to budget, capacity, or other reasons.

### Attached bids

This section shows all bids that include this location, giving you visibility into which customers are competing here and at what price points.

### Child locations

Locations are hierarchical. When viewing a specific location, you'll also see its children:

| When viewing | Children shown |
|--------------|----------------|
| Country | States |
| State | Counties |
| County | Zip codes |

This lets you drill down from broad regional trends to hyper-local demand patterns.
