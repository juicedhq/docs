Make the buyer portal feel like your own. Branding lets you customize the colors, logos, and icons your customers see when they log in and use the platform.

To configure your branding, select **Branding** from the tenant menu.

## Brand color

Your brand color is used for buttons, links, and accent elements throughout the buyer portal—including the sign-in page and navigation highlights.

Bold, saturated colors work best since this color appears as text on both light and dark backgrounds.

## Logos

Upload your company logo to replace the default Juiced branding in the buyer portal. Logos appear in:

- The navigation header
- Authentication pages (sign in, sign up, password reset)

- **Primary Logo** — Displayed by default and in light mode
- **Dark Mode Logo** — Displayed when a customer enables dark mode

A horizontally rectangular logo works best for these placements.

## Icons

Icons are used in smaller contexts where a full logo won't fit:

- **Favicon** — Browser tabs
- **Avatar** — Notifications and anywhere your company avatar is displayed

A square image works best for both. Most tenants use the same image for favicon and avatar.
