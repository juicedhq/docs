The Customer Portal is where you manage everything related to buying leads. Access it at your provider's `/app` URL—this is separate from the management interface your provider uses to run their operation.

## Wallet balance

In the top bar, you'll see your current wallet balance along with a color-coded funding status:

| Color | Status | What it means |
|-------|--------|---------------|
| <Icon icon="circle" color="green" size={12} /> Green | Available | You have enough funds to cover all your active bids |
| <Icon icon="circle" color="yellow" size={12} /> Yellow | Limited | At least one bid is being limited by your wallet balance |
| <Icon icon="circle" color="red" size={12} /> Red | Exhausted | Your balance doesn't cover the minimum for any bid |

Click on your wallet balance to go directly to the Billing page where you can add funds.

## Customer badge

You may also see a badge in the top bar that reflects your standing with your provider. Click on it to see:

- Your current return rate
- The badge title and description (if your provider uses dispute tiers)
- All available tiers and the return rates that qualify for each

If your provider doesn't use dispute tiers, clicking the badge will simply show your return rate.

## Customer switcher

If you have access to multiple customer accounts, you'll see a customer menu in the sidebar. Click it to:

- View other customer accounts you're attached to
- Switch between accounts
- Set up a new customer account
- Access your [Company Profile](/customer-portal/company-profile) (if you have permission)

Each customer account is a completely separate context—different payment methods, bids, leads, notifications, and contacts. Think of each customer as its own container for buying leads.

## Account status

If your customer account is paused or archived, you'll see an indicator in the top bar. A paused account means your bids aren't competing for leads. An archived account is no longer active—contact your provider if you believe this is an error.

## Portal sections

Here's what you'll find in the Customer Portal:

| Section | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| **Dashboard** | Quick overview of your recent leads and bid activity |
| **Leads** | Browse and export all your purchased leads |
| **Bids** | Create and manage your bidding profiles |
| **Marketplace** | Purchase leads directly from the real-time marketplace |
| **Notifications** | Configure who receives lead notifications and how |
| **Billing** | Payment methods, transaction history, and auto-recharge settings |
| **Bidding Limits** | Set daily, weekly, and monthly caps on leads and spending |
| **Company Profile** | Update your company name, contact info, and address |

## Getting started

If you're new to the Customer Portal, here's the typical flow:

1. **Add a payment method** — You'll need funds in your wallet to purchase leads
2. **Set up bidding** — Create a bid profile for the types of leads you want
3. **Configure notifications** — Make sure leads get delivered to the right people
4. **Set your limits** — Protect your budget with caps on spending and lead volume

Your provider may have already configured some of these settings for you when they created your account.
