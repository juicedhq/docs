description: Send real-time event data to external systems.

Webhooks let you send data to external systems whenever specific events occur in Juiced. When an event fires, the system sends a payload to your configured URL.

## Creating a webhook

1. Navigate to the webhooks settings page
2. Select the event you want to listen for
3. Click create
4. Configure the destination URL and payload

## Available events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Customer Created | A new customer account is created |
| Lead Assigned | A single lead is assigned to a customer |
| Leads Assigned | Multiple leads are assigned at once (e.g., bulk marketplace purchase) |
| Lead Duplicated | A lead is rejected as a duplicate |
| Lead Posted | A lead is sent to an external system |
| Transaction Updated | A transaction is created or updated |
| County Lead Type Stats Updated | Lead type statistics are updated at the county level |
| State Lead Type Stats Updated | Lead type statistics are updated at the state level |
| User Attached to Customer | A user is added to a customer account |

## Payload templates

Webhook payloads are JSON. You can customize the payload structure using a template with merge fields in double curly braces: `{{ variable_name }}`.

For lead assignment webhooks, the payload includes a `{{ deliverable_fields }}` variable that dynamically expands to all deliverable fields for the lead category as raw JSON key-value pairs. This means the payload automatically adapts when fields are added or removed from a lead category—no template changes needed.

For more details on customer-facing webhook configuration, see [Customer Portal > Notifications](/customer-portal/notifications#webhooks).

## How it works

When one of your configured events occurs, Juiced sends an HTTP request to your specified URL with the relevant payload. This allows you to:

- Sync data to your CRM
- Trigger automations in external tools
- Update dashboards or reporting systems
- Send notifications through your own channels
