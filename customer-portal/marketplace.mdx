The Marketplace shows leads available for immediate purchase. Unlike bidding—where you set prices and wait for leads to come to you—the marketplace lets you browse inventory and buy on demand.

The marketplace may not be available if your provider hasn't enabled it.

## How it works

Leads in the marketplace are sold through reverse auctions. Prices start high and drop over time until someone buys or the auction ends. You can either buy now at the current price or wait for a better deal—but risk losing the lead to someone else.

## What you'll see

Each lead in the marketplace displays:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **County** | Where the lead originated |
| **Lead type** | The type of lead |
| **Time received** | How long ago the lead came in |
| **Time remaining** | When the auction ends |
| **Current price** | What you'd pay if you buy right now |
| **Next price** | What the price will drop to, and when |
| **Floor** | The lowest the price will go |

You can filter the marketplace by lead type or location to find what you're looking for.

## Buying leads

You have two ways to purchase:

### Buy now

Click **Buy Now** to purchase the lead immediately at the current price. The amount is deducted from your wallet and the lead is delivered to you.

### Place a buy order

Don't want to watch the marketplace? Place a buy order at your target price and let the system do the work.

1. Click on a lead to open the buy order modal
2. Set the price you're willing to pay
3. Confirm your order

The buy order amount is **held from your wallet** immediately—not charged, just reserved. If the auction price drops to your number, you automatically win the lead. If someone else buys it first or outbids you, the hold is released.

You can cancel a buy order at any time before the lead sells.

## Competing for leads

When you place a buy order, check the floor badge color to see where you stand:

| Floor color | What it means |
|-------------|---------------|
| **Gray** | No buy orders on this lead |
| **Blue** | Someone else has a buy order, but you don't |
| **Green** | You have the leading buy order |
| **Red** | You have a buy order, but someone else is winning |

If another customer places a higher buy order than yours, you'll be notified (if you have notifications enabled). You can then increase your buy order to stay competitive or cancel to release your held funds.

## Wallet requirements

All marketplace purchases draw from your wallet balance. No balance, no buying. Make sure you have sufficient funds before browsing—there's nothing worse than finding the perfect lead and not being able to grab it.
