description: The central entity in Juiced—what they are, their statuses, and lifecycle.

Leads are the fruit of your labor. Literally everything in Juiced exists to get leads from point A (your sources) to point B (your customers) while making sure you get paid along the way.

A lead is a person who's expressed interest in something—a quote, a service, a product. Your job is to connect that person with a customer who can help them. Juiced handles the messy middle: validation, routing, bidding, delivery, and the occasional dispute.

## Lead statuses

Every lead has a status that tells you where it is in its journey. Here's what each one means:

| Status | What it means |
|--------|---------------|
| **Pending** | Just arrived. Waiting to be matched with a customer. |
| **Assigned** | Given to a customer. They've got it, whether or not the transaction is complete. |
| **Posted** | Sent out of the system to a partner via an external post. |
| **Duplicate** | Matched an existing lead. Rejected to avoid double-selling. |
| **Returned** | Customer returned it. Maybe the phone number was fake, maybe the lead wasn't what they expected. |
| **Unassigned** | Couldn't find a buyer. No matching bids, or everyone's out of budget. |
| **Withheld** | On hold because you've hit your threshold. Will process once capacity frees up. |
| **Marketplace** | Available for customers to claim rather than being pushed to a specific buyer. |
| **Audit** | Flagged for manual review based on your audit conditions. |
| **Uncategorized** | Doesn't match any segment, and no fallback was configured to catch it. |

A lead is considered "sold" if it's Assigned, Posted, or Returned. Yes, even returned leads count as sold—you delivered them, and the customer chose to return them afterward.
