Juiced uses volume-based pricing—the more you sell, the more you pay. No per-seat licenses, no surprise fees, no "contact us for pricing" runaround. Just straightforward tiers based on your monthly lead sales.

## Plans

Your plan is determined by your monthly lead sales volume (the total dollar value of leads you sell, not the number of leads). Pick the tier that matches your operation:

| Plan | Monthly Lead Sales | Price |
|------|-------------------|-------|
| Juicy Start | Up to $25,000 | $250/mo |
| Citrus Splash | Up to $50,000 | $500/mo |
| Berry Boost | Up to $100,000 | $1,000/mo |
| Tropical Temptation | Up to $150,000 | $1,500/mo |
| Orchard Oasis | Up to $250,000 | $2,500/mo |
| Mango Magic | Up to $500,000 | $3,500/mo |
| Pineapple Paradise | Up to $750,000 | $5,000/mo |
| Grapevine Glory | Up to $1,000,000 | $6,500/mo |
| Pomegranate Power | Up to $1,500,000 | $9,000/mo |
| Exotic Extracts | Up to $2,000,000 | $12,000/mo |
