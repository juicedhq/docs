Your Juiced tenant can have multiple users, each with their own login and role. Manage your team by selecting **Users** from the tenant menu.

## Inviting users

To add someone to your team:

1. Click the **Invite User** button
2. Enter their email address
3. Select a [role](/features/roles) for them
4. Send the invite

The invitee will receive an email with a link to accept the invitation and create their account.

## Pending invites

Invitations that haven't been accepted yet appear in the **Pending Invites** section. From here you can:

- See which invites are still outstanding
- Revoke invites that are no longer needed

Revoked invites become invalid immediately—if someone tries to use a revoked invite link, they'll be turned away.

## Managing existing users

For each user in your organization, you can:

- **Edit their role** — Change what they can access and do
- **Remove them** — Revoke their access entirely

Removing a user is immediate. They'll be logged out and won't be able to access your tenant.

## Roles

Roles determine what a user can see and do within your tenant. Juiced comes with four built-in roles:

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Admin** | Full access to everything. Can manage users, billing, settings, and all platform features. |
| **Customer Support** | Can view and manage customers, leads, bids, and transactions. Ideal for support staff. |
| **Sales** | Read access to leads and customers, plus the ability to send invites. Built for your sales team. |
| **Data Validation** | Limited to viewing and updating leads. Perfect for QA or data review tasks. |

For a detailed breakdown of what each role can do, see [Roles & Permissions](/features/roles).
