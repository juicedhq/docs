description: How customers bid on leads—scopes, pricing, and bid management.

Bidding determines how much customers pay for leads. Customers place bids at different geographic levels, and the highest bidder wins the lead.

## Bidding scopes

Bidding scopes are configured at the [segment level](/features/segments#bidding-scopes). Each scope defines:

- The geographic level (county, state, or nationwide)
- Minimum and maximum bid amounts
- Bid increment

## Global bid settings

The bidding settings page includes a global option to lock bids. When enabled, customers cannot make changes to their bids through the customer portal—only tenants can modify bids.

This allows tenants to create a fully managed pricing system where they control the price of all leads.

## Customer bidding access

You can restrict customers from accessing bidding until they've deposited a minimum amount of funds. Once they reach or surpass the threshold, bidding access is automatically granted.

Tenants control the messaging shown to customers in the modal that blocks their access. This is useful for scenarios like requiring customers to schedule a call with your sales team before they can start bidding.

## Smart pricing

Smart pricing ensures customers only pay what's necessary to win a lead—not their maximum bid. When a customer wins an auction, they pay one increment above the next highest bidder, regardless of how high they bid.

**Example:** If the minimum bid is $10 with $10 increments, and a customer bids $100 while the next closest bidder is at $10, the winner pays $20—not $100.

This encourages customers to bid their true maximum since they won't overpay when competition is low. It also means customers can confidently bid for top position without worrying about the actual price until the lead is won.
