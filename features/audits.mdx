Audit conditions work similarly to [duplicate checks](/features/duplicate-detection), but instead of rejecting leads, they hold them for manual review before processing.

## Creating audit conditions

When creating an audit condition, you configure:

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Name | Yes | A reference name for the condition |
| Lead type | Yes | Which lead type this condition applies to |
| Description | No | Optional notes about what this condition catches |

## Conditions

You must add at least one condition for the audit to trigger. Conditions can check against:

- **Metadata**: The segment or source associated with the lead
- **Lead data**: Any field values on the lead itself

## Working with audited leads

When a lead is held in audit status, you can:

- Review the lead data
- Edit the lead if corrections are needed
- Reprocess the lead once you're satisfied

This is the same editing and reprocessing workflow available for other lead statuses.
