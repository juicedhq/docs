title: Lead Categories
description: Schemas that define the structure and required fields for your leads.
---

Lead categories and [lead types](/features/lead-types) are classification concepts unique to Juiced. Together, they help you categorize leads based on who they are and what they're worth.

- **Lead category** represents who the person is and what they want to do
- **Lead type** refines that information to identify their level of intent and value

Think of lead categories as the "what" and lead types as the "how much."

## Basic fields

Every lead category comes with a set of basic fields automatically attached when you create it:

- First name
- Last name
- Email
- Phone
- Address 1
- Address 2
- City
- State
- ZIP
- County

You can't remove these fields, but you can configure their properties and add custom fields on top of them.

## Field properties

Each field has three important properties that control how it behaves during the lead lifecycle:

### Required for post

When a field is marked as required for post, it must be present when a lead is submitted to the system. If the field is missing, validation fails and returns a `422` status code. No lead is created.

### Required for ping

When a field is required for ping, it must be included during the ping phase of [ping-post](/features/ping-post). If it's missing, you'll get a validation error.

<Tip>
Keep required-for-ping fields to a minimum. However, including key fields in pings helps ensure you get accurate pricing since the system needs that information to determine which lead type a lead belongs to.

If a field is used in a condition to determine lead type but isn't included in the ping, that condition will fail. This can prevent leads from qualifying for more valuable lead types.
</Tip>

### Deliverable

Deliverable fields are visible to customers. They appear in the customer portal and are included when lead data is sent via webhooks.

<Note>
The entire system is geographically based, so ZIP code is always required. If you're generating leads at a state or national level only, you can pre-fill a valid ZIP code within the target state—or any valid US postal code for national campaigns.
</Note>

## Creating custom fields

When creating a new field, you'll need to provide:

| Property | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| Title | Yes | The field identifier. Must start with a letter or underscore and can only contain letters, numbers, underscores, and dashes. |
| Type | Yes | The data type and validation format. See [field types](#field-types) below. |
| Description | No | Optional explanation of what this field captures. |
| Required for post | No | Whether the field must be present when creating a lead. |
| Required for ping | No | Whether the field must be present during pings. |
| Deliverable | No | Whether the field is visible to customers. |

## Field types

Field types determine what kind of data a field accepts and how it's validated. Choose the type that matches your data format—the system will reject values that don't match.

### Text and numeric

| Type | Label | Format | Example |
|------|-------|--------|---------|
| `text` | Text | Any string value | `Hello World` |
| `numeric` | Numeric | Numbers only | `12345` |

### Contact information

| Type | Label | Format | Example |
|------|-------|--------|---------|
| `email` | Email | Valid email address | `lead@example.com` |
| `phone-us` | Phone (US) | US phone number | `218-686-7890` |
| `phone-us-ca` | Phone (US & CA) | US or Canadian phone | `250-555-0199` |
| `phone-au` | Phone (AU) | Australian phone | `0412345678` |
| `phone-international` | Phone (International) | Any valid international number | `+61412345678` |

<Warning>
Phone fields validate against actual carrier patterns, not just digit counts. A random 10-digit number may fail validation if it doesn't match a valid phone number format.
</Warning>

### Geographic

| Type | Label | Format | Example |
|------|-------|--------|---------|
| `zip` | Postal Codes | 4-5 digit US ZIP code | `90210` |
| `state` | States | 2-letter US state abbreviation | `CA` |

<Note>
ZIP and state fields cannot be marked as required for post or required for ping—these are handled at the system level since all routing is geographically based.
</Note>

### URLs and network

| Type | Label | Format | Example |
|------|-------|--------|---------|
| `url-scheme` | URLs with scheme | Full URL including protocol | `https://example.com` |
| `url-no-scheme` | URLs without scheme | Domain only, no protocol | `example.com` |
| `ip-address` | IP Address | IPv4 or IPv6 address | `192.168.1.1` |

### Dates

| Type | Label | Format | Example |
|------|-------|--------|---------|
| `ymd` | Date (YYYY-MM-DD) | ISO date format | `2024-01-31` |
| `mdy` | Date (MM/DD/YYYY) | US date format | `01/31/2024` |
| `dmy` | Date (DD/MM/YYYY) | European date format | `31/01/2024` |

### Date and time

| Type | Label | Format | Example |
|------|-------|--------|---------|
| `ymd-his` | DateTime (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS) | ISO datetime | `2024-01-31 14:30:00` |
| `mdy-his` | DateTime (MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM:SS) | US datetime | `01/31/2024 14:30:00` |
| `dmy-his` | DateTime (DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM:SS) | European datetime | `31/01/2024 14:30:00` |

### Identifiers

| Type | Label | Format | Example |
|------|-------|--------|---------|
| `uuid` | UUID | Standard UUID v4 | `123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000` |
| `ulid` | ULID | 26-character sortable ID | `01BX5ZZKBKACTAV9WEVGEMMV9V` |

### Constrained values

| Type | Label | Format | Example |
|------|-------|--------|---------|
| `list-of-values` | List of Values | One of a predefined set of options | `option_a` |

When using `list-of-values`, you'll define the allowed options as a comma-separated list when creating the field. Any value not in your list will fail validation.
