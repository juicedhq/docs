What's new, what's changed, and what's been squashed.

We ship updates frequently, and this is where we keep track of all of them. Whether it's a shiny new feature, a quality-of-life improvement, or a bug that finally got what was coming to it—you'll find it here.

## What you'll find here

- **New features** — Fresh functionality added to the platform
- **Improvements** — Enhancements to existing features
- **Bug fixes** — Problems we've identified and resolved
- **Breaking changes** — Anything that might affect your existing setup (we'll make these obvious)

## Staying in the loop

Updates are listed in reverse chronological order—newest first. If something affects your workflow, we'll call it out clearly so you don't have to play detective.
