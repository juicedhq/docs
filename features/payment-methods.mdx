description: How customers fund their accounts and fee configuration.

The payments and deposits settings let you control how customers fund their accounts, what fees apply, and what minimums are required.

## Transaction fees

You can apply a percentage fee to different types of charges:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Manual payment fee | Percentage applied when customers manually deposit funds |
| Auto-recharge fee | Percentage applied when accounts are automatically recharged |

These can be configured independently, so you could charge a fee on manual deposits but waive it for auto-recharges (or vice versa).

### First transaction waiver

You can optionally waive fees on a customer's first transaction. This is useful for encouraging new customers to fund their accounts without the friction of an upfront fee.

## Deposit minimums

Control the minimum amount customers can deposit for different transaction types. This helps ensure deposits are worthwhile after accounting for payment processing costs.

## Restricting payment methods

If you want to prevent customers from adding payment methods entirely—for example, if you handle billing outside of Juiced—you can disable this functionality.
