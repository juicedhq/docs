The Billing section is where you manage how your account is funded. It's organized into three tabs: Payment Methods, Transactions, and Auto Recharge.

## Payment Methods

This tab shows all payment methods linked to your account.

### Adding a payment method

Click **Add Payment Method** to link a new credit card. Once added, you can use it to manually deposit funds or set it up for automatic recharging.

### Adding funds

To deposit money into your wallet:

1. Click **Add Funds** on an existing payment method
2. Enter the amount you'd like to deposit
3. Confirm the transaction

The funds will be added to your wallet immediately and available for purchasing leads.

<Note>
Your provider may charge a transaction fee on deposits. The fee percentage (if any) will be shown before you confirm.
</Note>

### Managing payment methods

You can remove payment methods you no longer need. If you have multiple cards on file, you can set one as your default for auto-recharge.

## Transactions

The Transactions tab shows your complete financial history—every deposit, lead purchase, refund, and fee. Use it to track spending, reconcile your records, or investigate specific charges.

Each transaction displays:
- Date and time
- Transaction type (deposit, charge, refund, etc.)
- Amount
- Running balance

## Auto Recharge

Auto recharge keeps your wallet funded automatically so you never miss a lead due to insufficient funds.

### How it works

When your wallet balance drops below a threshold you set, your default payment method is automatically charged to bring your balance back up.

### Configuring auto recharge

1. **Enable auto recharge** — Toggle it on
2. **Set your threshold** — The balance that triggers a recharge
3. **Set your recharge amount** — How much to add when triggered

For example, if you set a $100 threshold and $500 recharge amount, your card will be charged $500 whenever your balance drops below $100.

<Note>
Your provider may set minimum deposit amounts and charge different fees for auto-recharge versus manual deposits.
