description: Integrate with Juiced to submit leads programmatically.
---

The Juiced API lets you submit leads programmatically, check pricing before committing, and integrate your lead sources directly with the platform.

## Base URL

All API requests are made to:

```
https://usejuiced.com/api
```

## Headers

All requests must include these headers:

```
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json
```

## Authentication

The API supports two authentication methods:

### Basic Authentication

Use your source's API key and secret, Base64-encoded in the format `api_key:api_secret`.

```bash
curl -X POST https://usejuiced.com/api/leads \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Basic $(echo -n 'your_api_key:your_api_secret' | base64)" \
  -d '{"first_name": "Katy", "last_name": "Berry", ...}'
```

### Bearer Token

Use a bearer token generated for your source.

```bash
curl -X POST https://usejuiced.com/api/leads \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_token_here" \
  -d '{"first_name": "Katy", "last_name": "Berry", ...}'
```

You can find your API credentials in your source settings within Juiced.

## Endpoints

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `POST /ping` | Check for pricing before submitting a full lead |
| `POST /leads` | Submit a complete lead for processing and distribution |

## Ping-post workflow

The typical integration flow uses both endpoints:

1. **Ping** — Send partial lead data (at minimum, a zip code) to check for matching bids and get pricing
2. **Post** — If the price is acceptable, submit the full lead with the `ping_id` from step 1

This two-step process lets you make informed decisions about which leads to sell and at what price before committing.

You can also skip the ping and instead post the lead directly if you don't need to check pricing first.

## Source-specific fields

The exact fields available—and which ones are required—depend on your source and lead type configuration. The documentation here covers the standard fields, but your source may have additional requirements.

<Note>
For the exact API spec tailored to your source (including your credentials and all configured fields), visit **Sources → [Your Source] → View API Spec** in your Juiced admin dashboard.

## Error handling

The API returns standard HTTP status codes:

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `200` | Ping processed successfully |
| `201` | Lead created successfully |
| `401` | Authentication failed |
| `422` | Validation error (check the `errors` object for details) |

Validation errors include detailed messages for each field that failed:

```json
{
  "message": "The given data was invalid.",
  "errors": {
    "email": ["The email field must be a valid email address."],
    "zip": ["The postal code is not valid for this account's operating countries."]
  }
}
```
