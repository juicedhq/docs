Integrations connect Juiced to third-party services that extend your platform's capabilities.

## Stripe

<Note>
Stripe integration is required for your tenant to operate.
</Note>

Stripe handles all payment processing—customer deposits, lead purchases, and payouts. Without a connected Stripe account, customers won't be able to fund their accounts or purchase leads.

## Twilio

Twilio enables SMS notifications. Once connected, you can send text message alerts to customers for events like new lead assignments, low balance warnings, or custom triggers configured through [workflows](/features/workflows).

## SendGrid

SendGrid powers email notifications. Connect your SendGrid account to send transactional emails for lead deliveries, account updates, and other system events.

## Google Tag Manager

Google Tag Manager allows you to add tracking and analytics to the customer portal. Once configured, you can deploy marketing tags, conversion tracking, and analytics scripts without modifying code.

## Intercom

Intercom adds customer support and engagement features to the customer portal:

- **Support bubble**: In-app chat for customers to reach your support team
- **Product tours**: Guided walkthroughs to onboard new customers
- **Targeted messaging**: Send announcements and updates to specific customer segments
